# Project 10: Around The U.S.

### Overview
In this project we created a React App.  We took our previous fully functional javascript site and remade it in React.

**React**
I really enjoyed working in React.  I found it more intuitive than javascript.  I hope to work with it again.  

**Functions**
Unfortunately, at this stage, this site is not yet fully functional.  Right now, there are five popups that open and close but they do not have functions other than this.  As of now, the site make only two Api calls to the server.  It retrieves the list of cards to display and shows who the profile belongs to.  There is also an ongoing count of likes.

**Conclusion**

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the site!
